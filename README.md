Pet meet-up web application

HelloPets (name subject to change) is a web-based application helping pet owners arrange playdates for their pets. The application assists pet owners by matching them with other pet owners who want their pets to come into contact and play with other pets.The process is facilitated by getting possible pet owners to come into contact with other pet owners via online event bulletins. A pet owner initiating a playdate for their pet posts a playdate bulletin with the appropriate details regarding the date. Other registered and interested pet owners can then decide to join in on the playdate and send messages to the host. By streamlining the process of setting up playdates, pet owners can be at ease in setting up fun-filled meetings for their beloved pets.
